PROJECTS

Personal Website in ReactJS and TailwindCSS | Github
▪ Designed and created jordanrobertsdeveloper.com, written in Javascript, React, and TailwindCSS.
▪ Implemented responsive UI design that scales across desktop and mobile devices.
▪ Organized the project using version control (git) and Github to keep track of changes.

Flappy Bird in C++ and OpenGL | Github
▪ Developed a recreation of the mobile game Flappy Bird in low level c++ and OpenGL.
▪ Researched and combined various 3rd-party libraries such as GLM, ImGui, and OpenGL/glew.
▪ Learned how to communicate between the CPU and GPU using OpenGL and shaders to make a real-time

    high-performance application.
▪ Abstracted underlying OpenGL calls to maintain readability and scalability.

2D Physics Simulator in C++ and OpenGL | Github
▪ Developed a 2D physics simulator that uses physics to intuitively resolve collisions in C++ and OpenGL.
▪ Adapted and modified the rendering code from the above project to be more high-performance for the given

    use case due to the large number of objects and computations.
▪ Shifted the focus and design to a more data-driven programming paradigm to improve the high-performance

    nature of the application.
